# Systematic Trading Strategies

A Python-based project developing systematic trading strategies, with an initial focus on portfolio construction techniques including Mean-Variance Optimization, Minimum Variance Portfolio, Maximum Diversification, Black-Litterman Model, and Equal Risk Contribution.
## Overview
This repository implements portfolio construction methods to optimize asset allocation for systematic trading. Built with Python (pandas, NumPy, yfinance), it uses public data to demonstrate quant finance techniques.
## Portfolio Construction

+ **Mean-Variance Optimization**: Maximizes Sharpe ratio balancing returns and risk.
+ **Minimum Variance Portfolio**: Minimizes portfolio volatility.
+ **Maximum Diversification**: Maximizes diversification ratio across assets.
+ **Black-Litterman Model**: Incorporates investor views with market equilibrium.
+ **Equal Risk Contribution**: Equalizes risk contributions from each asset.

## Setup
`pip install pandas numpy yfinance scipy matplotlib`

## Usage

+ Clone repo: git clone https://github.com/amankedia/Systematic-Trading-Strategies.git
+ Run scripts in portfolio_construction/ (e.g., mean_variance.py).

## Progress

+ May 2025: Initial setup with Mean-Variance Optimization and Minimum Variance Portfolio.
+ Future: Add Maximum Diversification, Black-Litterman, Equal Risk Contribution, and backtesting.
